## Project Summary

This is a **simple Todo application** built using **Flask, Python, and SQLite**.  

**Purpose:**  
The app helps users keep track of tasks. You can add, update, and delete todos.  

**How it works:**  
- The app uses **Flask routes** to handle different pages (home page, update page).  
- **Templates** (`index.html`, `update.html`, `base.html`) are used to display content dynamically.  
- Todos are stored in a **SQLite database**, so your tasks are saved even after you close the app.  
- You can add a new todo, update existing ones, or delete them using buttons on the page.  
- The app uses **Bootstrap** for a clean and simple user interface.  

This is designed to be **easy to understand for beginners** learning Flask.
